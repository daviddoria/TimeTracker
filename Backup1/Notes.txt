use
Dim FilterString As String = String.Format("Associate = 'Renee Entremont' AND TimeField >= #{0:M/dd/yyyy}#", StartDate) 
instead of 
Dim FilterString As String = "Associate='Renee Entremont' and TimeField>=#" & StartDate & "#" 

Select a single day:
Dim SelectString As String = "associate='" & Name & "' and timefield>=#" & DateOfEvents & "# and timefield <#" & DateOfEvents.AddDays(1) & "#"
OR BETTER IS
SELECT  Associate, TimeField, InOut, Reason, [Key]
FROM     PunchEventTable
WHERE  (Associate LIKE ?) AND (Reason LIKE ?) AND (datediff('d', TimeField, ?) = 0)
ORDER BY TimeField

Create a new row:
Do this
Dim PunchInNewRow As TTDataSet.PunchEventTableRow = EventTable.NewPunchEventTableRow
instead of this:
Dim PunchInNewRow As TTDataSet.PunchEventTableRow
